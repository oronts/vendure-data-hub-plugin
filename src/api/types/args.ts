/**
 * DataHub GraphQL Resolver Arguments
 *
 * Common argument types used in resolver methods.
 * These types define the structure of query/mutation arguments.
 *
 * NOTE: This file was cleaned up - all previously defined argument interfaces
 * were unused (resolvers use inline argument types instead of importing these).
 * The barrel export in index.ts is kept for potential future use.
